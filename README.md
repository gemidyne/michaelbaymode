MichaelBayMode
============
A SourceMod plugin for Team Fortress 2 which I should probably regret ever making. 

- If a player dies, they will create a massive explosion and shake nearby player's screens.
- If you shoot your weapon, you scream "RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!".
- It also changes/randomises the pitch of sounds played by the game engine.

## WARNING
Please note that this plugin can cause extreme server and client instability if the sm_explosions console variable is set too high with many players and high entity counts.
